Image-Spider

Works very well and you can ask for the type of image you want the scrapper to collect. Also follows a specific urls path depending on keyword selection. Still not happy with the spider and will continue the project in the futur.

Works with Rapid API for search for initial queries can be easy adapted to use other initial
links solution.
