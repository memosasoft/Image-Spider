**Image-Miner**

Is an smart image spider. 

- It as a search interface to start de scrapping process
- It has as scoring system to make a decision about what images to download
- It makes its ways and works without supervision
- It verifies textual html for keyword
- It check link for keywords

More intelligence is on the way...

Works very well and you can ask for the type of image you want the scrapper to collect. 
Also follows a specific urls path depending on keyword selection. 

**Final verdict**
Still not happy with the spider and will continue the project in the futur.

Works with Rapid API to search for initial URL can be easy adapted to use other initial links solution.
