**Image-Hunter**
The new name for Image-Miner

Image-Hunter is personal AI project. The project implements ideas about search engines, web spiders, autonomous agents, machine learning, self-learning and natural language processing. 

**SCRAPER-SEARCH-ENGINE**

The system is slowly becoming a search engine. It was the goal of the image retrieval project. 

Soon development will be transferred to the search engine project.

**HARD-CORE DEVELOPEMENT**

The project is evolving very quickly.

Image-Hunter has new features that enable users to search the net based on images. 

The HTML interface presents not only the images but some of the web content giving the user the choice to visit the source of the images to look for more images or for a specific article. 

**WEB INTERFACE**
The script opens automatically a browser showing the images results in different views. 

Search query can be done with the terminal. 

You simply enter a query or phrase and the system retrieves the images and some of the information related to your search query. 

The HTML views will popup when the image-hunter.py script is started. 

The interface is in development and will use JavaScript. 

I want an advanced image viewing interface and I am currently doing research about certain javascripts libraries that have image viewers integrated into them. 

**PACKAGING**
I will soon package everything and prepare installation documentation for quick installation of the scraper-spider.

**INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE**
Image-hunter is the new name of Image-miner

https://github.com/memosasoft/image-miner

**Miner features and functionality**

    Works with Google, Yahoo and Bing
    It learns from web site and user input
    It check link, images alt tag, images filename and web page path
    It has a simple scoring system QS (Quality Score)
    It extracts and reads html content
    It as an simple html interface
    It as a database to keep track of information
    It build a depot of all images
    It keeps a history

There is also one config.env file that lets you play with the parameters of the scrapper.

Note don't forget to change the PROGRAM_PATH

PROGRAM_PATH = file:///home/linux/Bureau/Programmation/image-miner-X/dev/image-hunter.html

**WEB SERVER ON THE WAY**
Web server version is being implemented.  

**Supported Image formats**
psd,apng,avif,bmp,gif,ico,cur,tif,tiff,jpg,jpeg,jfif,pjpeg,pjp,png,svg,webp,webm,ogg,wav,tiff,ico,jpg,gif,png,bmp

**Database with SQLite3**
Database Integration is completed with sqlite.

**Image depot**
During testing in the past 4 weeks it gathers : 85000 images and icons.

**Learning to learn**
More intelligence is on the way...

**MY WISH LIST for 2022**

    Search library optimization
    Automatic Search Results
    Archiving development  
    DB development
    Vision development
    Enhance AI  
    Smarter search algorithms
    Better roaming and crawling

**NEXT PHASE**
Image-Hunter will have the ability to judge the quality of an image. It already does a very impressive job with no visual information.

When the vision algorithm will be ready the software will do an amazing job.
